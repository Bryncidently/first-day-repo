        Once upon a time there was a lovely 
        princess. But she had an enchantment 
        upon her of a fearful sort which could 
        only be broken by love's first kiss. 
        She was locked away in a castle guarded 
        by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
        Many brave knights had attempted to 
        free her from this dreadful prison, 
        but non prevailed. She waited in the 
        dragon's keep in the highest room of 
        the tallest tower for her true love 
        and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
        Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
        a load of - (toilet flush)
